Connect to Astra DB using Node.js and OpenFaaS
==============================================

This repository accompanies an article on the OpenFaaS blog. You can fork or adapt this example for your own use with OpenFaaS or Astra DB and Node.js.

## Usage:

Read the article: [Serverless storage for your functions from the Datastax Astra DB](https://www.openfaas.com/blog/faas-storage-cassandra-astra/)

If you need somewhere to host OpenFaaS, there's a quick-start for [Linode](https://www.linode.com/openfaas), here: [Deploy OpenFaaS to Linode with K3sup](https://www.openfaas.com/blog/openfaas-linode/)

Examples in this repository:

* [cycling](/cycling/) - Node.js example using Astra DB and the Cassandra Driver
* [weekly-newsletter](/weekly-newsletter/) - Node.js for Astra DB using the Document SDK

You will need to sign up for an account for [Astra DB and managed Cassandra](https://dtsx.io/2VYD4I4) to use the Document SDK example. The cycling example will work with any managed Cassandra service or local/open-source installer such as [K8ssandra](https://k8ssandra.io/).
